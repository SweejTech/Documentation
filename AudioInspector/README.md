# SweejTech Audio Inspector

Thanks for getting our Audio Inspector for Unreal Engine 5! It allows people working with sound to see detailed, useful info about all active sounds in game in a compact editor tab window.

## Installation

Get the plugin from Unreal Marketplace. Enable it. That's it!

## Usage

To open the tab window, open the Window menu at the top of the editor and select SweejTech Audio Inspector. Dock the window anywhere you like, or keep it floating!

## Customisation

To customise the SweejTech Audio Inspector, open the Editor Preferences window and find Audio Inspector under the SweejTech header. You can customise:


- Which columns are shown
- The colour scheme for the Volume column
- The update rate of the UI
